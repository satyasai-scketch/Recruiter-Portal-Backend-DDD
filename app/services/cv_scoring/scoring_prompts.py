CV TEXT:

YOUR TASK: HOLISTIC ASSESSMENT

You are an expert evaluator. Assess this subcategory by considering ALL factors together:

1. DEPTH & BREADTH:
   - How deep is their expertise? (beginner mention vs. production experience vs. expert/architect)
   - How broad is their coverage? (1 tool vs. multiple tools in this area)
   - Quality of evidence: specific projects, metrics, outcomes vs. just listing keywords

2. REQUIRED ITEMS COVERAGE:
   - Count items found vs. total required (using semantic matching)
   - But consider: Is it better to have deep expertise in 70% of items, or shallow mentions of 90%?
   - Missing critical items hurts more than missing nice-to-have items

3. RECENCY & RELEVANCE:
   - Recent experience (last 2-3 years) is most valuable
   - Experience from 3-5 years ago: still good but slightly less relevant
   - Experience >5 years old without recent updates: significantly less valuable

4. LEVEL CALIBRATION (use as reference, not rigid rules):
   - Level 5: Expert/Architect - Deep mastery, leadership, multiple advanced projects
   - Level 4: Advanced - Production experience, complex implementations, mentoring others
   - Level 3: Intermediate - Solid working knowledge, completed real projects independently
   - Level 2: Basic - Some exposure, assisted on projects, limited independent work
   - Level 1: Awareness - Knows it exists, minimal or no hands-on experience

5. SCORING GUIDANCE (not formulas - use judgment):

   EXCEEDS expectations (actual > expected):
   → 95-100% range
   - Strong depth + high coverage + recent → 98-100%
   - Strong depth + good coverage → 95-97%
   - Good depth but lower coverage → 92-95%

   MEETS expectations (actual = expected):
   → 85-95% range
   - Excellent evidence + high coverage → 92-95%
   - Strong evidence + good coverage → 88-92%
   - Solid evidence + decent coverage → 85-88%
   - Meets level but thin coverage → 82-85%

   ONE LEVEL BELOW (actual = expected - 1):
   → 60-80% range
   - Almost there, strong partial match → 75-80%
   - Good foundation but gaps → 68-75%
   - Some relevant experience but limited → 60-68%

   TWO+ LEVELS BELOW:
   → 0-55% range
   - Two levels below + some coverage → 40-55%
   - Three levels below or minimal evidence → 10-30%
   - No relevant evidence → 0-5%

IMPORTANT: Don't mechanically apply formulas. Think like a hiring manager:
- Would you confidently say this person can handle this aspect of the job?
- Are they missing critical skills or just nice-to-haves?
- Is their experience deep and recent, or shallow and dated?
- Does the overall picture inspire confidence?

Use GRANULAR scores (67%, 83%, 91%) that reflect your honest assessment.

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Use SEMANTIC matching (abbreviations, related fields) - NOT keyword matching
2. Extract actual CV quotes as evidence in your notes
3. Think holistically: depth + breadth + coverage + recency all together
4. Be fair but honest: Don't inflate scores, but recognize transferable skills
5. Consider: Would a hiring manager be confident this person can do the job?
